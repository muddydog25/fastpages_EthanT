Evolution
A pattern and process
Evolution is NOT goal oriented
Individual organisms do not evolve. Populations evolve
Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium allows us to mathematically calculate allele frequency
Evolution is pressured and driven by environment 
Variation





Traits are heritable 
Some organisms (i.e. spores &amp; humans) overproduce purposely
Overproduction is done as when there are low-resources, not all offspring survive - overproduction ensures that at least some organisms survive.
Three types of selection
Directionaly 
Stationary
Disruptive
Microevolution
Evolution of a group or species occurring over a small period of time
