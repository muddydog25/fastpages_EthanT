<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned…</h2>
<p>The Qualcomm Career Series events helped me understand the importance of leadership and working in teams. From the presentations, I learned about how essential it is to be able to work together with a team in order to help solve problems. Furthermore, it was noted that scrum-like processes and working in groups allows us to work more efficiently - freeing up the mental capacity that we need to help innovate. Two important messages I heard in the presentations were “Whenever any doubt enters your mind, remember that you can lead from any chair.” The other message was to always ask “What is the purpose?” in regards to what we are/are trying to achieve with our team. I could relate to the first message as I am my table’s scrum master, which involves me having to take charge and lead my team, filling in any roles when necessary. The second message helped to open my mind in terms of not just following instructions, but to go above and beyond - asking questions helps us learn more. Finally, the last key thing I learned from the seminar was to never question yourself. You do not want to think that you do not deserve a certain role or job in a company, as that can affect our performance- if we question our own abilities, then we can never see our true potential. These were the key principles that I have learned from the Qualcomm Career Series presentations.</p>
