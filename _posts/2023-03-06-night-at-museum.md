<h2 id="My-Experience">My Experience<a class="anchor-link" href="#My-Experience"> </a></h2><p>This trimester's Night at the Museum was amazing! There were many amazing sites I was able to view, along with other pieces of art from the various other exhibitions at the event. It was gratifying to present my feature and to show my team's project off to visitors. During the event, we were able to allow people to actually test out our website and describe the behind the scenes "magic," which was our frontend to backend communication for various features ie. my car search and Taiyo's comments.</p>

One of those tools was a notes tracker by Amay Advani. This allowed notes to be saved for specific classes, these notes were then saved into a database in the their group's backend.</p>
