## PBL Prototyping  (planning and creative development)
- Link to my [scrum-board](https://github.com/users/realethantran/projects/1)
- I want to make a personality quiz
- The quiz will use a points system
- The quiz will also store data so people can see previously recorded results
- The actual "score" will not be displayed, rather the given personality
- The personality will have to be calculated using the score
- For theming, I want to make the quiz to determine whether someone is a "Early Bird" or a "Night Owl"
- Similar to my fastpages, the colors will mostly consist of light blue and white
