## PBL Prototyping  (planning, purpose, and function)
- Link to my [scrum-board](https://github.com/users/realethantran/projects/1)
- I want to make a personality quiz
- The quiz will use a points system
- The quiz will also store data so people can see previously recorded results
- The actual "score" will not be displayed, rather the given personality
- The personality will have to be calculated using the score
- For theming, I want to make the quiz to determine whether someone is a "Early Bird" or a "Night Owl"
- Similar to my fastpages, the colors will mostly consist of light blue and white 

## PBL Code/Code/Coding (Use data abstraction, code management, etc.)
- Using a simple onClick function, I am able to create buttons
- The functions allow me to add points and switch pages for the given buttons
- The points system uses variables ("a" & "b"), "a" is for the Early Birds, while "b" is for the Night Owls.
- I found that using the createRecord block, I can store data that is saved even after the application is closed. 
- Through the records, I can display past results and update the records in real-time (data abstraction).

Note: I will need time to collect data to show for the demo of the application 

## PBL Test 
- Using Test-driven development (TDD), I have now been able to complete the first rendition of my app.
- The application works as it should be and is ready to be demoed
