### Reflection

**Discrepancies:** While I gave this submission full points, College Board graded it a 5/6. This is due to a difference between our scores for row 1, in which I gave the submission full credit - College Board however, did not.

**What my program will need:** My submission will need to explain both the purpose and function of the program without missing any details no matter how significant or small.

**Why the submission may have failed:** This submission most likely failed due to a failure to properly explain the purpose of the program completely. 

## Submission 4

## My Score: 4/6
## College Board's Score: 3/6

### Reflection

**Discrepancies:** While College Board gave this submission a score of 3/6, I graded it a 4/6. This is due to a difference in our score for row 6.

**What my program will need:** My program will need to completely describe the complexity and data contained in the list(s) that I decide to make. 

**Why the submission may have failed:** This submission failed to utilize the data stored in the list that is a part the code. To add, the list does not manage any sort of complexity, the written portion also fails to both recognize and explain the use of the list to manage complexity. Lastly, this submission does not feature any testing points that use any sort of arguments or separate functions. With these failures meet the given criteria, the submission earned a total score of 3/6 by College Board.
