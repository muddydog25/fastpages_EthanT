## My Score: 2/6
## College Board's Score: 1/6

### Reflection
**Discrepancies:** The score that I gave was 2/6, while College Board graded this submission 1/6. I had believed that the submission properly met all of the requirements for row 1, but College Board disagreed. 

**What my program will need:** My program will need to feature a detailed description of the functionality. Furthermore, I must also make sure that my code runs as intended before submitting my work.

**Why the submission may have failed:** The submission did not completely describe the functionality nor show the correct output of the program.

## My Score: 6/6
## College Board's Score: 6/6

### Reflection

**Discrepancies:** There are no discrepancies between my score and that of College Board for this submission. We both gave this submission a 6/6.

**What my program will need:** I will need to make my program and writing the best work that I can possibly put out - making sure to meet each criteria prior to submission. This will help to ensure that my submission receives full points.

**Why the submission got full credit:** This submission got full credit due to the fact that it excellently passes each of the criteria given by College Board, making no mistakes. The writing portion is very clear and properly explains each detail that is on the College Board rubric.

## My Score: 6/6
## College Board's Score: 5/6

### Reflection

**Discrepancies:** While I gave this submission full points, College Board graded it a 5/6. This is due to a difference between our scores for row 1, in which I gave the submission full credit - College Board however, did not.

**What my program will need:** My submission will need to explain both the purpose and function of the program without missing any details no matter how significant or small.

**Why the submission may have failed:** This submission most likely failed due to a failure to properly explain the purpose of the program completely.

## My Score: 4/6
## College Board's Score: 3/6

### Reflection

**Discrepancies:** While College Board gave this submission a score of 3/6, I graded it a 4/6. This is due to a difference in our score for row 6.

**What my program will need:** My program will need to completely describe the complexity and data contained in the list(s) that I decide to make. 

**Why the submission may have failed:** This submission failed to utilize the data stored in the list that is a part the code. To add, the list does not manage any sort of complexity, the written portion also fails to both recognize and explain the use of the list to manage complexity. Lastly, this submission does not feature any testing points that use any sort of arguments or separate functions. With these failures meet the given criteria, the submission earned a total score of 3/6 by College Board.
