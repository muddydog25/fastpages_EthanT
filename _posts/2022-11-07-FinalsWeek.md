## Overall Class Experience
This was quite an informative class that has helped me step into the world of Computer Science. I enjoyed the various projects and assignments given to us, as they helped us develop skills that we can use in the future. 

## Night at the Museum Experience
<p>Night at the Museum was a very interesting and awesome experience. Some notable works I saw were a recreation of Kahoot and a Marvel comic tracker. It was really cool to see the framework and code of various other teams across the AP CSP periods. It was also very gratifying to present our team's website, which was an NBA team tracker. There were many people that were intrigued with our project and gave us compliments. One particular moment I remember was a young child that asked us to input the Trailblazers, who were his favorite team. When we showed the information, he was really interested in our app and said that it was really cool.</p>

### Missed Problems

<p>The code segment first adds the values of x and y, then divides the sum by x, then prints the result. The value of x must not be 0; otherwise a divide-by-zero error will occur when result is divided by x.</p>

<p>If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 â€“ 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174.</p>

<p>The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50.</p>

## Problems/Difficulties
There were a few problems that I had issues with. I had previously watched the College board videos to help me prepare for this quiz. I found that though I was quite prepared, there were some problems that were tricky. Another fault I found was that I went through this quiz a bit quickly, so some of these missed questions may be due to myself going over the quiz too quickly. I think that I need to practice more and look over more of the overall theory of this course. Since taking the test, I have taken a look at some online videos and read over the material on the College board website.
