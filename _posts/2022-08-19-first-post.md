Hello, my name is Ethan Tran and this is my first markdown post. 

 <body>
        <button onclick = "aboutMe()" style = "background-color: #89CFF0; color: #FFFF; border-color: #79F6FC; font-size: 1.5em" > About Me </button>
        <p id = "test">  </p>
        <script>
            function aboutMe(){
                document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = "I am born and raised in San Diego, and in my spare time like to watch videos on various topics such as finance, cars, and history. I also enjoy going to the beach as well as spending time with my family and friends."; 
                ![](../../../../Pictures/beachwithfriends.jpg)
            } 
            </script>
            </body>

### Closing statement
I hope to improve my skills with Python and get adjusted to IDEs such as VS Studio. Cheers!
