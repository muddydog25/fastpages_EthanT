## Rohin Sood
- In-depth commentary regarding the process of running the local flask and fastpages servers
- Detailed python explanation ie. going in-depth on the ports and changes
- Completely demonstrates commits, syncs, and changes to each local server - as well as a permanent change to his fastpages website

### Grade & Final Statement
Rohin, overall your video was detailed and was easy to follow along. Despite these successes, it was still well above the time limit (around 1 minute), for that I would have to give you a 2.6.

## Taiyo Iwazaki
- Nice editing of the video itself
- Contains all of the necessary demonstrations ie. local servers & committing to GitHub
- Features the Human Day Notes

### Grade & Final Statement
Taiyo, great job on the video, I appreciate the use of text labels and background music. Your project has all of the necessary components but it is quite long and is above the expected duration of 1 minute. Due to that, I would have to give you a 2.6.

## Luna Iwazaki
- Displays all of the processes 
- Straight to the point and easy to follow
- Edits make the video asthetically pleasing

### Grade & Final Statement
Luna, nice job! Your video is straight to the point as mentioned above, and you have all of the needed processes and changes working/running. For that, I would grade you a 2.7.
