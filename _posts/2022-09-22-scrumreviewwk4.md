## Rohin 
- In-depth commentary regarding the process of running the local flask and fastpages servers
- Detailed python explanation ie. going in-depth on the ports and changes
- Completely demonstrates commits, syncs, and changes to each local server - as well as a permanent change to his fastpages website

### Grade & Final Statement
Rohin, overall your video was detailed and was easy to follow along. Despite these successes, it was still well above the time limit (around 1 minute), for that I would have to give you a 2.6.
