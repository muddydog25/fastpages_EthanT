One particular moment I remember was a young child that asked us to input the Trailblazers, who were his favorite team.

<h2 id="problemsdifficulties">Problems/Difficulties</h2>
<p>There were a few problems that I had issues with. I had previously watched the College board videos to help me prepare for this quiz. I found that though I was quite prepared, there were some problems that were tricky. Another fault I found was that I went through this quiz a bit quickly, so some of these missed questions may be due to myself going over the quiz too quickly. I think that I need to practice more and look over more of the overall theory of this course. Since taking the test, I have taken a look at some online videos and read over the material on the College board website.
&lt;/html&gt;</p>
