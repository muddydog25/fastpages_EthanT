- [x] includes two program code segments:

- one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the programâ€™s purpose.
- [x] identifies the name of the variable representing the
list being used in this response.

representing in the program.

- [x] includes a program code segment that shows a list
Complexity being used to manage complexity in the program.
- [x] explains how the named, selected list manages
complexity in the program code by explaining why
the program code could not be written, or how it
would be written differently, without using this list.

on the functionality of the procedure.
- one showing where the student-developed
procedure is being called
- [x] describes what the identified procedure does and
how it contributes to the overall functionality of the
program.

to the procedure. 
- [x] identifies the result of each call
