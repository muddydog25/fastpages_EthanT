    "1) Q: Explain, in your own words, why abstracting away your program logic into separate, modular functions is effective\n",
    "   \n",
    "    A: Abstracting away program logic into separate, modular functions is effective when coding because it makes the code easier to read and understand, more reusable and maintainable, and allows for better organization and structure. By breaking down large, complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions, it can help to simplify the code and make it more organized, which makes debugging and troubleshooting much easier. Additionally, modular functions are easier to update and extend, since they can be tested, modified, and replaced independently. This can help reduce the amount of code needed to be written and improve the overall code quality. Finally, modular functions make code more reusable, as they can be used in multiple projects and functions, which can lead to faster development times and reduced maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Create a procedure that uses other sub-procedures (other functions) within it and explain why the abstraction was needed (conciseness, shared behavior, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure below requires abstraction as it allows the function to organize the code as a whole. Abstracting the variables x and y allows me to not have to call the variables over and over again within the same function."
