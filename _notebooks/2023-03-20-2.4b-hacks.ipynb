    "- In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural abstraction is displayed in this implementation through the division of tasks among various functions. For example, the menu function acts as a control method where the user can select what operation they want to complete. The create() function follows this, prompting the user for the necessary details, and then establishing a cursor object to connect with the database. After executing the appropriate SQL command to insert the data, the connection and cursor objects are closed. Therefore, the entire process of creating a user record is conducted by calling the create() function. This is an example of procedural abstraction, as there is a specific function dedicated to each task and the user can complete the desired operation by using the menu function.\n",

    "- In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture\n",
    "    - Do you see data abstraction?  Complement this with Debugging example.\n",
    "\n",
    " This implementation showcases data abstraction, as the details of working with the database are kept hidden from the user. They are provided with a simple interface to perform common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data. This is done through a menu system, which provides an abstraction of the operations available and hides the implementation details from the user. As an example of this, when the user select the \"create\" option from the menu, they are prompted to input the required information (name, uid, password, dob). The implementation then automatically takes care of inserting this information into the database.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the OOP, the create() function is called on an object. On the other hand, in imperative programming, several variables need to be created within the function instead. Both of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. The imperative approach is less prone to errors but also less efficient, whereas the create() in the OOP version does the opposite. Furthermore, the imperative version does not censor passwords whereas OOP is better for working with large amounts of data. If one is dealing with a small amount of data, then the imperative approach may be more suitable.\n",

    "2. Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL INSERT statement used in the code is used to add a new row of data to the \"users\" table of a SQLite database. The INSERT INTO statement defines the table name and columns for the data to be added, and the VALUES clause provides the values associated with each column. The ? placeholders help prevent SQL injection attacks by cleaning user input. The INSERT INTO statement can be likened to the init method of a User class, as they both serve to create a record or object within the database. The distinction is that the INSERT INTO statement only adds data to a table in the database, while the init method of a User class creates a new instance of a class in memory."
