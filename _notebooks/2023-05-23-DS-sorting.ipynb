The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list and compares the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, the two elements are swapped. The algorithm then moves on to the next two elements and repeats the process. This continues until the end of the list is reached."

    "The list passed into Bubble Sort in Python is \"pass-by-reference.\" This means that the function receives a reference to the original list rather than a copy of the list. Any modifications made to the list within the function will be reflected in the original list outside the function.
