    "\n",
    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",

    "To implement CORS into your own website, you will need to add the following HTTP headers to your server responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies the origin(s) that are allowed to make cross-origin requests.\n",
    "- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed for cross-origin requests.\n",
    "- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header specifies the HTTP headers that are allowed to be sent with cross-origin requests.\n",

    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why one might want to implement CORS into your own website.

    "1. What is the purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal?\n",

    "\n",
    "DNS stands for Domain Name System.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the purpose of DNS? \n",
    "\n",
    "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participants. Most prominently, it translates easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By translating human-readable hostnames into machine-readable IP addresses, the Domain Name System makes the Internet more user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does DNS work? \n",
    "\n",
    "DNS works by using a distributed database of DNS records. These records map domain names to IP addresses. When a user types in a domain name, their computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server. The DNS server then looks up the domain name in its database and returns the corresponding IP address. The user's computer then uses the IP address to connect to the website or other online resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a DNS resolver?\n",
