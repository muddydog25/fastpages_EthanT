    "- An experiment is a structured procedure that is undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact. Simulations, on the other hand, are used to attempt to replicate real-world events or situations in order to test or predict outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The advantages of using simulations include that they can be safer, more cost-effective, more efficient, and they can provide more data in less time than experiments. However, the downside of using simulations is that they are not as accurate as experiments and outside factors such as gravity and air resistance may not be included in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations should not be used when a situation already has set results or data that won't change, such as a score in a game, the most purchased food item, or the average yearly wage. In these cases, an experiment would not be necessary since the data is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations are a form of computer modeling that enables the analysis of a system by using mathematical models and algorithms to simulate the behavior of the system’s components. Simulations are used to study a system’s performance, its interactions with other systems, and its dynamic behavior over time. Simulations can be applied to any type of system, from simple mechanical systems to large, complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations typically involve a combination of software and hardware components. The software component is responsible for creating a mathematical model of the system, which may include equations that describe the behavior of the system’s components and their interactions with each other. The hardware component is responsible for running the simulation, by executing the mathematical model and generating the results of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations can be used to study a variety of things, such as the performance of a system, the effects of changes to the system, or the behavior of a system over time. By running multiple simulations with different input values, researchers can gain insight into how a system will behave under different conditions. Simulations can also be used to test the accuracy of mathematical models, or to compare different models of the same system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations are a powerful tool for studying complex systems, as they provide a way to analyze the behavior of the system without actually having to build or test the system. They can also provide insight into the behavior of a system under a variety of conditions, allowing researchers to identify areas of improvement or potential problems. Simulations can be used to test new designs or to gain a better understanding of how a system works before building it."

    "\n",
    "John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton game, meaning it consists of a grid of cells that change state based on a set of rules and the states of their neighbors. The game was developed by John Conway in 1970 and has since become a popular subject in mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game consists of a 2-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can have one of two states: \"alive\" or \"dead\". A cell is considered alive if it has two or three neighbors that are alive, and is considered dead if it has fewer than two neighbors or more than three neighbors. The cells then evolve over time based on these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of the game, any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation or overpopulation. Any deceased cell that has three living neighbors shall turn into a live cell - simulating reproduction. All other cells remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game can be implemented in many ways, but is often seen as a \"zero-player\" game, meaning that once the initial setup is complete, the game proceeds by itself. As a result, it has been used to study the behavior of complex systems and to explore emergent behavior."
