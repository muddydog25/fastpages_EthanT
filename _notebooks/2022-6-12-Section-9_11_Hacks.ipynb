    "1) Developing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding\n",
    "This ensures that it is sequenced correctly\n",
    "You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language\n",
    "Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm\n",
    "This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Review of Selection and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached\n",
    "To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration\n",
    "Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Why use algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug."
