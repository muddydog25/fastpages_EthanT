    "**Discrepancies**: In terms of scoring, I had given this submission a total score of 5/6, while College Board graded it a 4/6. Both College Board and myself agreed upon a lack of managing complexity. Where I was mistaken was when I was grading the program purpose and function. For the criteria of the written portion, I had thought that the submission checked all of the boxes. College Board took a point off due to a lack of actually explaining the purpose of the program - rather the submission only explained the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What my program will need**: My program will need to meet all of the criteria, leaving no possibilities of mistake. This is due to the fact that even if a single point is marked off, then the entire submission will be graded a 0. For example, Submission 1 was missing the explanation of the purpose of their program and program management that was not as efficient as College Board had wanted - resulting in an F/Fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the submission may have failed**: The submission may have failed because College Board took a point off due to a lack of actually explaining the purpose of the program - rather the submission only explained the function. Additionally, the use of program management was lackluster, which also invoked a 0/1 from College Board."
