    "## Notes\n",
    "- Chat GPT was sponsored by Microsoft and now has 10 billion dollars since they think it's the google killer. The GPT saves from the secondary clicking, donâ€™t know the source (cite sources). Good because you can answer right away. \n",
    "- Computer bias: Are we inserting our own bias into our programs? Can an AI be biased? Ex. HP facial scan bias based on skintones\n",
    "- Digital Divide: There is division between social classes and access to technology\n",

    "- Three Benefits of computing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Increased productivity and efficiency through automation of tasks.\n",
    "2) Enhanced scientific research and discovery through data analysis and simulation.\n",
    "3) Improved communication and access to information through the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three Harmful Effects of computing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Increased dependence on technology and potential for digital addiction.\n",
    "2) Decreased privacy and security due to the collection and storage of personal information.\n",
    "3) Job loss and unemployment due to automation of certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The effects of Dopamine:\n",
    "- Personally, I believe that video games can be quite addicting for some people. However, I believe that the dependency on video games and affect that they have on an individual's livelihood depend on the individual themself. If a person holds themself accountable for their hours online, then I think that there are no issues and that the impacts on studying can be eliminated. \n",

    "\n",
    "1) In the digital world, one can empower themselves by preventing cyber bullying and by developing skills to protect their privacy online. To add, they can also seek out various different perspectives and opinions online to help broaden their understanding of the real and digital world. \n",
    "2) One who is digitally empowered can use their knowledge to teach others. At Del Norte, students can help each other understand technology better and have discussions regarding online privacy and safety. \n",
    "3) At times, paper or red tape can prevent digital empowerment. This is because they do not support the use of technology. At Del Norte, I do not believe that such barriers are common as most classes have options to take digital notes and many assignments are performed/completed via a device such as a computer or laptop. In other parts of the world, even in San Diego County, there are schools in which not all of the students can afford to own their own devices. This prevents digital empowerment and is known as digital divide. "

    "\n",
    "- Inequality in access to education and job opportunities, as those without access to technology may have limited resources and information.\n",

    "- Worsening of  socio-economic differences, as those without access to technology may face even greater challenges in areas such as finance, healthcare, and government services."
