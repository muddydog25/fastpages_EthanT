The program prompts the user to enter the distance and fuel used for each entry in their trip, calculates the total mileage and fuel used for the trip, and then calculates the average MPG by dividing the total mileage by the total fuel used. Finally, the program displays the average MPG to the user.\n",

This function takes two input parameters, trip_mileage and fuel_used, which are both lists of floating-point values representing the distance and fuel used for each entry in the trip. The function then returns the average MPG as a floating-point value.\n",

The program uses loops to iterate through the user input and store it in lists, which are then passed to the calculate_avg_mpg() function for processing. By separating the input collection and processing logic into different functions, the code becomes more modular and easier to understand.\n",

The program prompts the user to enter the number of entries for their trip, initializes empty lists for trip mileage and fuel used, iterates through the number of entries and prompts the user to enter the distance and fuel used for each entry, calculates the total mileage and fuel used for the trip, calculates the average MPG by dividing the total mileage by the total fuel used, and finally displays the average MPG to the user.\n",

Additionally, a user can test the program with different input values to ensure that it handles various scenarios correctly.\n",

    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think this program does a good job of calculating the average MPG for a trip based on the distance and fuel used. One thing that stands out to me is the use of separate lists for the distance and fuel used, which allows for easy iteration through each entry of the trip and accurate calculation of the total mileage and fuel used. I also like the use of procedural abstraction with the calculate_avg_mpg() function, which makes the main function easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that could be improved in this program is the user input process. Right now, the program simply prompts the user for input without any validation or error handling. I can add some error handling to ensure that the user is entering valid input, such as checking that the distance and fuel used are both positive numbers. Additionally, I can also provide more detailed output to the user, such as displaying the individual mileage and fuel used for each entry in addition to the average MPG. Lastly, I still need to test my code more using different test cases - to ensure that it properly works. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think this program is a good starting point for calculating the average MPG for a trip, but there are certainly areas for improvement and additional features that could be added to make the program more user-friendly and versatile."
