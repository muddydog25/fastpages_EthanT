    "\n",
    "- The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics that involves repeating two simple arithmetic operations on any given positive integer. This will eventually produce a sequence of numbers known as Hailstone Numbers, \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If the input is 7, the Hailstone Numbers would be 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Iteration is the action or process of repeating a sequence of operations until the desired result is achieved. Undecidable problems are those which should give a yes or no answer, yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm efficiency in computer science refers to how efficient an algorithm is at solving a given problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency is typically measured in terms of time and/or space complexity, meaning how much time and/or memory is needed to complete the algorithm. Algorithm efficiency is an important factor in determining which algorithm should be used to solve a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time Complexity: This measures the amount of time required to execute an algorithm. Time complexity is usually expressed as a function of the input size, and can be calculated using Big-O notation. Generally, algorithms with a lower time complexity are considered more efficient than those with a higher time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space Complexity: This measures the amount of memory required to execute an algorithm. Space complexity is also expressed as a function of the input size, and can also be calculated using Big-O notation. Generally, algorithms with a lower space complexity are considered more efficient than those with a higher space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimization Techniques: Optimization techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of an algorithm. These techniques can involve modifying the algorithm itself, or using data structures and algorithms that are better suited to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Parallelism: Parallelism is a technique that allows multiple parts of an algorithm to be executed simultaneously. This can significantly reduce the amount of time required to complete the algorithm, but can also increase the complexity of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion,** algorithm efficiency is an important factor in determining which algorithm should be used to solve a particular problem. Factors such as time complexity, space complexity, optimization techniques, and parallelism should all be taken into consideration when assessing the efficiency of an algorithm."
