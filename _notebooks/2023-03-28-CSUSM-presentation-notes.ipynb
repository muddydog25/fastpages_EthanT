    "# Reflection\n",
    "As a student, I found the presentation by Cal State University San Marcos to be very informative and encouraging. One of the key takeaways for me was the emphasis on not letting failures define me. I think this is an important mindset to have, especially in a STEM major where there are often challenges and setbacks. Another thing that stood out to me was the versatility of a Computer Science degree. It was mentioned that CS majors have the opportunity to work in various industries and fields, which is reassuring since it means that there are many different career paths to choose from. I was also impressed by the programs offered at CSUSM. The Masters in Cybersecurity and Computer Engineering are degrees that I would definitely consider pursuing. Additionally, the Summer Scholars program and Quantum Bridge program both seem like great opportunities for hands-on research experience. The various STEM clubs at CSUSM, such as Robotics and 3D Printing, also caught my attention. I think these clubs would be a great way to connect with other students who share similar interests and to learn from their experiences. Another key topiic that stuck with me was the emphasis on seeking out grants and scholarships to help pay for college. With the rising costs of tuition and the burden of student loans, it's crucial to explore every option available to alleviate some of the financial strain. I also appreciated the information on FAFSA and the different types of loans available, such as subsidized and unsubsidized. Understanding the difference between these two types of loans and how they work can help me make informed decisions about my financial future. Furthermore, the presentation highlighted the importance of internships and networking to gain experience and advance in my field. Lastly, the point made about applying for internships even if I feel unqualified is reassuring as it reminds me that sometimes, taking risks can lead to unexpected opportunities and growth. Overall, this presentation provided valuable insights into the various aspects of college and gave me a better understanding of what to expect in terms of finances, opportunities, and career paths. As I continue my academic journey, I will keep these insights in mind and utilize the resources available to me to make the most of my college experience."
