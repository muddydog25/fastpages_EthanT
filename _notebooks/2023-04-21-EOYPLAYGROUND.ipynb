    "Lists are ordered data compilations. They can hold a wide range of data types, including strings, numbers, and objects. Lists are formed with square brackets, and their elements are separated by commas. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are unorganized compilations of facts. Curly brackets are used to build them, and dictionary items are key-value pairs. A key is a value's unique identifier. Any data type, including texts, numbers, and objects, can be used as a value. \n",

    "Overall: \n",
    "1. Lists are faster than dictionaries for accessing elements by index. \n",
    "2. Dictionaries are faster than lists for accessing elements by key.\n",
