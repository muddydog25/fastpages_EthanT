The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list and compares the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, the two elements are swapped. The algorithm then moves on to the next two elements and repeats the process. This continues until the end of the list is reached."

    "- Comparisons: Bubble Sort compares each element with the adjacent element, so in the worst case (reverse sorted list), it performs n*(n-1)/2 comparisons.\n",
    "- Swaps: Bubble Sort swaps elements if they are in the wrong order, and in the worst case, it requires n*(n-1)/2 swaps.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).\n",

    "- Comparisons: Selection Sort makes (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n*(n-1)/2 comparisons in the worst case.\n",
    "- Swaps: Selection Sort makes at most n-1 swaps in the worst case.\n",
